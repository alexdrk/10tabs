10tabs
======

limits chrome's open tabs to 20
When you try to open the 21st tab the plugin instead sends you to the least recently used tab :)

TODO
----
##when you reach the limit and for example open a link in a new tab
it doesn't open instead it just redirects you to a new tab - have to fix this
##packaged version .. until then go to extensions load unpacked extension
